This blockchain will have all of the following features:

1.	A proof of work algorithm to secure the network.
2.	Hashing algorithms to secure the data within the blockchain.
3.	The ability to mine (create) new blocks that contain data.
4.	The ability to create transactions and store them in blocks.
5.	An API/server that will be used to interact with the blockchain from the internet.
6.	It will be hosted on a decentralized blockchain network.
7.	A consensus algorithms to verify that the network nodes have valid data and are synchronized.
